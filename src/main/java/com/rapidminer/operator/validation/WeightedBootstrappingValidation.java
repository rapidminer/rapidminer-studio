/**
 * <p>
 * This validation operator performs several bootstrapped samplings (sampling with replacement) on
 * the input set and trains a model on these samples. The remaining samples, i.e. those which were
 * not sampled, build a test set on which the model is evaluated. This process is repeated for the
 * specified number of iterations after which the average performance is calculated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The basic setup is the same as for the usual cross validation operator. The first inner operator
 * must provide a model and the second a performance vector. Please note that this operator does not
 * regard example weights, i.e. weights specified in a weight column.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This validation operator provides several values which can be logged by means of a
 * {@link ProcessLogOperator}. All performance estimation operators of RapidMiner provide access to
 * the average values calculated during the estimation. Since the operator cannot ensure the names
 * of the delivered criteria, the ProcessLog operator can access the values via the generic value
 * names:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>performance: the value for the main criterion calculated by this validation operator</li>
 * <li>performance1: the value of the first criterion of the performance vector calculated</li>
 * <li>performance2: the value of the second criterion of the performance vector calculated</li>
 * <li>performance3: the value of the third criterion of the performance vector calculated</li>
 * <li>for the main criterion, also the variance and the standard deviation can be accessed where
 * applicable.</li>
 * </ul>
