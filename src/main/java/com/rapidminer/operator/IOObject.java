/**
 * This interface must be implemented by all objects that can be input/output objects for Operators.
 * The copy method is necessary in cases where meta operator chains want to copy the input
 * IOContainer before it is given to the children operators. Please note that the method only need
 * to be implemented like a usual <code>clone</code> method for IO objects which can be altered
 * after creation. In all other cases the implementation can simply return the same object. Hence,
 * we use the name <code>copy</code> instead of <code>clone</code>.
