/**
 * Operators can change their behaviour from one version to another. Hence, their version is stored
 * in the process XML file. If the behaviour of an operator changes from, say, version 5.0.003 to
 * 5.0.004, we can notify the user in version 5.0.004. To that end, the method
 * {@link Operator#getCompatibilityLevel()} will return 5.0.003, whereas
 * {@link Operator#getIncompatibleVersionChanges()} will return [5.0.003] (or a superset thereof) in
 * version [5.0.004], so that we can detect that the behavior changed.
 * 
 * 
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The version numbers always refer to the plugin the operator is loaded
 * from. If it is not loaded from a plugin, it refers to the RapidMiner version.
