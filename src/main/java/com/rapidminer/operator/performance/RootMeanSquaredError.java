/**
 * The root-mean-squared error. Mean-squared error is the most commonly used measure of success of
 * numeric prediction, and root mean-squared error is the square root of mean-squared-error, take to
 * give it the same dimensions as the predicted values themselves. This method exaggerates the
 * prediction error - the difference between prediction value and actual value of a test case - of
 * test cases in which the prediction error is larger than the others. If this number is
 * significantly greater than the mean absolute error, it means that there are test cases in which
 * the prediction error is significantly greater than the average prediction error.
