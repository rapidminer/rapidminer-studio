/**
 * DistributionModel is a model for learners which estimate distributions of attribute values from
 * example sets like NaiveBayes.
 *
 * Predictions are calculated as product of the conditional probabilities for all attributes times
 * the class probability.
 *
 * The basic learning concept is to simply count occurances of classes and attribute values. This
 * means no propabilities are calculated during the learning step. This is only done before output.
 * Optionally, this calculation can apply a Laplace correction which means in particular that zero
 * probabilities are avoided which would hide information in distributions of other attributes.
