 * This operator constructs a bootstrapped sample from the given example set. That means that a
 * sampling with replacement will be performed. The usual sample size is the number of original
 * examples. This operator also offers the possibility to create the inverse example set, i.e. an
 * example set containing all examples which are not part of the bootstrapped example set. This
 * inverse example set might be used for a bootstrapped validation (together with an
 * {@link IteratingPerformanceAverage} operator.
