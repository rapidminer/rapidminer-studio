 * This class represents a container for objects within a given distance from another object.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is a simple data structure with associated query and setting methods enabling a linked list of
 * all distance-Containers for all objects in a search Room. As most objects in a SearchSpace are
 * expected to be at different distances to each other, only a small number of objects is likely to
 * be linked to a single distance Container. However, in very dense clusters the number can increase
 * significantly.
