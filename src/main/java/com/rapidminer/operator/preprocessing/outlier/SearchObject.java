	 *       The parameter (int) kindOfDistance defines the kind of distance to compute, Attn.: If
	 *       no kind of distance is specified properly, EUCLIDIAN is set as a default to prevent
	 *       malfunction. A Warning is printed to STDOUT accordingly.
	 * 
	 *       <p>
	 *       The first parameter, however, as in the older getDistance function, is the SearchObject
	 *       to which the distances is to be measured.
	 * 
	 *       <p>
	 *       For further information: The difference between EUCLIDIAN distance and COSINE distance
	 *       is as follows:
	 *       <p>
	 *       d_euclidian(X,Y)=SQUARE_ROOT(SUM_i((x_i - y_i)^2)) and
	 *       <p>
	 *       d_cosine(X,Y)=SUM_i(x_i * y_i) / (SQUARE_ROOT(SUM_i(x_i)) * SQUARE_ROOT(SUM_i(y_i)))
	 *       <p>
	 *       Or in other words, while euclidian distance is measuring the metric distance between
	 *       two vectors equalling the norm of the subtraction of the two vectors, the cosine
	 *       distance is measuring the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. The cosine
	 *       distance is used especially for measuring the similarity between texts represented by
	 *       their vectorized term structure (e.g. using Term Frequency or Inverse Term Frequency -
	 *       TF/IDF) for the purpose of Information Retreival.
	 *       <p>
	 *       inverted cosine distance is supported by computing 1-cos distance, as with cosine in
	 *       the interval between [1; 1/2*pi] is monotonic and falling, from [1;0] and the largest
	 *       angles actually have the smallest value, it might very well be useful to invert the
	 *       scala to sine distance (1-cos distance) for reflecting increasing angles resulting in
	 *       increasing values for the distance used. Attn: the effect in this case decellerates,
	 *       e.g. the larger angles have less difference in distance values, hence a grouping of
	 *       objects kind of explodes in the middle and gets denser in the outer ring.
	 *       <p>
	 *       Therefore, in addition, the actual angle in radiant is introduced. With this kind of
	 *       distance, the direct angle between obejects is used, resulting in a linear monotonic
	 *       growing distance representation.
	 *       <p>
	 *       Overall, the user should decide on which kind of distance is to be used depending on
	 *       the actual application, as some distance measures can have VERY funny effects is used
	 *       in the wrong way.
