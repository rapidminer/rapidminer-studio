/**
 * Reimplementation of the Java 1.0 Observer pattern. It has some advantages:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Separation of interface and implementation</li>
 * <li>Generics argument to the update method</li>
 * <li>and foremost: The update method can be called on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) if this is
 * desired. If you don't know, what the EDT is, read the Java docs on Swing and synchronization and
 * use EDT if you register an observer that updates Swing GUI components.</li>
 * <li>synchronization (Sun's implementation may be synchronized, too, but it is not documented)</li>
 * <li>defined exception handling.</li>
 * </ol>
