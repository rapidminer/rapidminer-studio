/**
 * This class can be used to calculate the coefficients of a (weighted) linear regression. It uses
 * the class Matrix from the Jama package for most purposes and the class RealMatrix from Apache for
 * matrix multiplication because it is faster. It is also possible to apply Ridge Regression which
 * is a sort of regularization well suited especially for ill-posed problems. Please note that for
 * the dependent matrix Y only one column is allowed.
