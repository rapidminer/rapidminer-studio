/**
 * This class implements a bounded priority queue which contains always the n-th smalles values. If
 * a new value is added, it is added only if it is smaller than the greatest value already in queue.
 * The greatest value is then removed. The iterator does not iterate in any particular order. This
 * queue will implement a reverse order in compare with the java PriorityQueue, so peek and poll
 * will retrieve the greatest elements
