/**
 * <p>
 * WARNING: This class is now deprecated. Please use the class {@link Process} instead!.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class was introduced to avoid confusing handling of operator maps and other stuff when a new
 * experiment is created. It is also necessary for file name resolving and breakpoint handling.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you want to use RapidMiner from your own application the best way is often to create an
 * experiment from the scratch (by adding the complete operator tree to the experiment root
 * operator) or from a file (for example created with the GUI beforehand) and start it by invoking
 * the {@link #run()} method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @deprecated Please use the new class {@link Process} instead
