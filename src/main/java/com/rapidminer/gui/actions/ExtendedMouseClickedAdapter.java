/**
 * This class is an extension of the regular Swing {@link MouseAdapter}. The advantage of this class
 * is that it fires its {@link #click(MouseEvent)} method both for a regular click (where the mouse
 * does not move between mousePressed and mouseReleased) and clicks where the mouse is pressed,
 * moved and then released. This solves the irritating issue that only perfectly still clicks count
 * as clicks in Swing.
 * <p>
 * To add a popup menu, simply overwrite {@link #showContextMenu(Point)} which triggers on popup
 * clicks.
