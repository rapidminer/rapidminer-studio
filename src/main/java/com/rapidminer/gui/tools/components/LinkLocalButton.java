/**
 * Can be used as a label that triggers a local action event on every link activation click. To use
 * a link button which opens a URL in the web browser, use {@link LinkRemoteButton} instead. The
 * local and the remote link button may use different color schemes or other indicates so the user
 * knows what is about to happen before he clicks the link.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Action#NAME} property of the action will be the label text. It can either contain no
 * HTML tags in which case the entire label will become the link or it can contain an <a href=#> tag
 * and regular text in which case only the content of the tag will become the link. The icon
 * property of the action is ignored.
