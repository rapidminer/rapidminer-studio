	<step name="Build prediction models.">
		<text>The previous tutorial demonstrated how predictive modeling can reveal insights about your data. 
		You might not have been able to see the effect of gender or family size on survival by just looking at the data alone. 
		This tutorial will now show how we can use these insights to predict future outcomes. 
		More specifically, we will use the Naïve Bayes method to predict the "Survived" class (yes / no) of each passenger and find their respective confidences. </text>
		
		<info>
			Using a model to generate predictions for new data points is called <emph>Scoring</emph>.

	<step name="Train the model.">
		<tasks>
			<task>
				<activity>
					Drag the
					<file>Titanic Training</file>
					data
				</activity>
				from the <folder>Samples</folder> repository into your process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Add</activity> a <op>Naive Bayes</op> operator and <activity>connect it</activity>.
			</task>
		</tasks>

		<info>
			So far, this process simply builds a Naïve Bayes model, as we have seen before. Next, we need to use an operator called <op>Apply Model</op> that will create predictions for a new, unlabeled data set.
		</info>
	</step>


	<step name="Apply Model.">
		<tasks>
			<task>
				Search for the operator <op>Apply Model</op> and 
				<activity>drag it</activity> into the process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>
					Drag the
					<file>Titanic Unlabeled</file>
					data
				</activity>
				from the <folder>Samples</folder> repository into your process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Connect</activity> the "mod" output port (green) of  
				<op>Naive Bayes</op> to the green input port of <op>Apply Model</op>.
			</task>
			<task>
				Also, <activity>connect</activity> the unlabeled data with the 
				"unl" input put (blue) of <op>Apply Model</op>.
			</task>
			<task>
				Finally, <activity>connect</activity> the blue example set output of <op>Apply Model</op> 
				with the "res" result port on the right side of the <ui>Process</ui> panel.
			</task>
		</tasks>

		<info>You might be wondering what the "unl" and "lab" ports mean on the <op>Apply Model</op> operator. The operator takes <emph>unlabeled</emph> data as an input, applies the model you connected to the "mod" port, and outputs a data set with a label: the predictions made by the model.</info>
		<info>
As we learn about more advanced operators in RapidMiner, the function of their ports becomes more important. If you are ever curious about what a port does, just hover your mouse over it to see its full name.

		<info>
			The result is the original unlabeled data with a column for the 
			predicted class (yes / no) of "Survived" and two additional columns for the confidences of the 
			two different classes (yes / no) of "Survived".  For example, the first row of the data the prediction 
			is "yes" with 98.7% confidence and "no" with 1,3% confidence.

	<step name="Congratulations!">
		<text>Good job! Scoring data with a predictive model is a simple task with the 
		<op>Apply Model</op> operator. Just remember to make sure that the format of the unlabeled data 
		is the same as the format of the data used for training.  Use the same attributes, 
		and if possible, the same value ranges.  While some models are robust enough to handle 
		significant data changes, others might fail more easily.</text>

		<questions>
			<question>
				Sort the data set so that it shows the cases with the highest probability of 
				survival. What percentage of the top 10 people with the highest probability 
				to survive is female?
			</question>
			<question>
				Replace the Naive Bayes operator with a Decision Tree. How does this effect 
				the confidences of the predictions? Can you imagine why?
