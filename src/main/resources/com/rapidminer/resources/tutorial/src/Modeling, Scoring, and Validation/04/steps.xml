	<step name="Get better estimations for accuracy.">
		<text>In the last tutorial, we saw how easy it was to create an estimation for 
		the accuracy of the model by splitting your data into a training and testing set. 
		But what if the training and tests sets had significant differences between them? 
		Our performance estimate might be based on a particularly "easy" or "hard" test set! 
		This tutorial introduces a technique called <emph>Cross Validation</emph> to make 
		sure each data point is used as often for training as it is for testing which avoids this problem.
		</text>
		
		<info>
			<emph>Cross validation</emph> divides the example set into equal parts and rotates 
			through all parts, always using one for testing and all others for training the model.  
			At the end, the average of all testing accuracies is delivered as result. 
			This is a great way to compute the accuracy of models and should become your standard 
			estimation approach whenever the additional computation efforts are feasible.

	<step name="Load the data and feed it into the validation.">
		<tasks>
			<task>
				<activity>
					Drag the
					<file>Titanic Training</file>
					data
				</activity>
				into your process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Add</activity> the operator 
				<op>Cross Validation</op> to the process and <activity>connect it</activity>.
			</task>
		</tasks>

		<info>
			<op>Cross Validation</op> is the name of the operator performing the cross validation and
			it needs a labeled input example set.  By default this splits the data into 10 different parts, so we 
			call this a 10-fold cross validation.  You can of course change the number of folds in the <ui>Parameters</ui> panel.
		</info>
	</step>


	<step name="Train and apply the model.">
		<info>
			Note the small icon in the bottom right corner of <op>Cross Validation</op>. 
			Recall that this means the operator can have other operators nested in it. 
			In fact, <op>Cross Validation</op> has two sub-processes, one for training 
			the model and one for testing it. Double-click on the operator to view its sub-processes.
		</info>
		
		<tasks>
			<task>
				<activity>Double-click</activity> the <op>Cross Validation</op> operator. 
				The <ui>Process</ui> panel now shows two sub-processes named 
				<ui>Training</ui> and <ui>Testing</ui>.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Add</activity> a <op>Decision Tree</op> to the <ui>Training</ui> sub-process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Connect it</activity> with the ports delivering the training data 
				on the left and outputting the model on the right.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Add</activity> <op>Apply Model</op> to the <ui>Testing</ui> sub-process.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Connect</activity> the model and the testing data from the left to <op>Apply Model</op>.
			</task>
			<task>
				Also <activity>add</activity> the operator <op>Performance</op> to <ui>Testing</ui>.
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Connect</activity> the output of <op>Apply Model</op> with <op>Performance</op> and the 
				output of <op>Performance</op> with the first average port "ave" on the right.
			</task>
		</tasks>

		<info>
			Every performance delivered at the "ave" port on the right will be averaged together and delivered to the "ave" output port 
			of the <op>Cross Validation</op> operator.  Also, note that you can fully control what happens inside of 
			the cross-validation.  This allows you to take into account the effects of preprocessing 
			like normalization or feature selection, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.

	<step name="Connect to result ports and run process.">
		<tasks>
			<task>
				Go back to the main process by clicking on <icon>16/nav_up.png</icon> in the top left corner 
				of the <ui>Process</ui> panel or by clicking on the link called "Process".
			</task>
			<task>
				<activity>Connect</activity> the green model and yellow averaged performance ports to 
				the result ports on the right.

				the process and inspect the results.
			</task>
		</tasks>

		<info>
			Note that the accuracy now has an additional number (after the "+/-") indicating 
			the standard deviation of the performances from our cross validation. The standard 
			deviation gives us an idea of how robust the model is: the smaller the standard deviation, 
			the less dependent the model performance is on the test data set.
		</info>
		
		<info>
			The model that is returned is the model trained on the complete data set, and not one of 
			the models from inside the cross validation.  We deliver this as a convenience to you, but keep 
			in mind that a cross validation is only about estimating the accuracy of the model, not 
			about building the best one.  In general, you should build models on as much data as possible.

				<activity>Select</activity> the <op>Cross Validation</op> operator by clicking on it.

				<activity>Look</activity> at the <ui>Parameters</ui> panel.  You will notice that some parameters 
				have green carets <icon>16/legacy_down_green.png</icon>.  Parameters marked by this are  
				frequently changed by RapidMiner users.

			<task>
				<activity>Click</activity> on the caret next to <param>number of validations</param>.  A small chart will 
				appear showing you how many users have changed this parameter and what they typically 
				change it to.
			</task>
			<task>
				You can see that another typical value for the number of cross validation folds is 5 or 6.

			Whenever you see those green carets in RapidMiner, you can access the <emph>Wisdom of the Crowds</emph>. 
			RapidMiner gives you recommendations for optimizing your process based on the habits of

	<step name="Congratulations!">
		<text>Well done, you have learned how to properly validate supervised machine learning 
		models! The fact that you used <emph>all</emph> of your data for testing makes cross-validation 
		a much stronger method than a single split-validation. The modular design of the <op>Cross Validation</op> 
		operator also allows you to nest preprocessing operators inside of it, leading to even better estimations!
		Unfortunately, this will come with a resource cost: if you do a 10-fold cross validation, you need to train
		10 models. This adds extra number-crunching to your process and can increase the required execution time.</text>

		<questions>
			<question>
				Does cross validation also work for unsupervised learning where the data does 
				not have a label?
			</question>
			<question>
				Change the process so that you get a 2-fold cross validation. Use breakpoints 
				inside the Cross Validation to find out how large the training and the test sets 
				are now. What is your expectation?
			</question>
			<question>
				Which is the best model: Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Rules, or Neural Net? Try them all and find out  
				which one has the highest accuracy.
