In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and a Signed Agreement, the terms of the Signed Agreement shall prevail. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and an Order, the terms of the Order shall prevail.

The Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, agency, joint venture or partnership between the parties or to impose any liability attributable to such a relationship upon either party.
10.6 Notices.  All notices under this Agreement will be in writing, and will be deemed given when personally delivered, when sent by confirmed fax, prepaid certified or registered U.S. mail, return receipt requested, or a recognized delivery service to the address of the party to the address set forth above, or to such other address as such party last provided to the other by written notice.

10.9 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be construed to have been adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall not have the effect of rendering any such provision invalid or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provisions of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable whatsoever.

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any rights or obligations of either party under this Agreement, shall be effective, except pursuant to a written instrument signed by the party or parties waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing.  The failure of either party to require the performance of any term of this Agreement or the waiver of either party of any breach under this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision hereof, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the other party hereto.
10.11 Governing Law.  The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall govern this Agreement, without giving effect to applicable conflict of laws provisions or to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. 
10.12 Jurisdiction.  The parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to this Agreement shall be in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and each of the parties hereby agrees to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of any such action.
10.13 Equitable Relief.  The covenants of Licensee in Section 3 and Section 5 hereof are of a special and unique character, and Licensee acknowledges that money damages alone will not reasonably or adequately compensate RapidMiner for any breach of such covenants.  Therefore, RapidMiner and Licensee expressly agree that in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, in addition to other rights or remedies which RapidMiner may have, at law, in equity, or otherwise, RapidMiner shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief compelling specific performance of, and other compliance with, the terms of such Sections. 
10.14 Force Majeure.  RapidMiner shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance hereunder caused by reason of any occurrence or contingency beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, riot, civil disturbance, acts of any civil or military authority, judicial action, terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake, strike, delays in transportation, unavailability or shortages of labor, materials or equipment, failure or delays in delivery of vendors and suppliers, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, Internet disruptions, common carrier interruptions, breakdown in facilities, power failure or other accidents or unforeseen circumstances.  The obligations and rights so excused shall be extended on a day to day basis for the period of time equal to that of the underlying cause of the delay.
10.15 Remedies.  No remedy referred to in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to herein or otherwise available at law, in equity or otherwise.
10.16 Construction.  The section and paragraph headings used in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Both parties acknowledge that they have been represented by counsel in the negotiation of this Agreement, and hereby waive any canon of construction that would require any portion of this Agreement to be construed against the drafter thereof.
