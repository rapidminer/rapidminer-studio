9.5 Compliance with Laws.

9.10 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be construed to have been adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall not have the effect of rendering any such provision invalid or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provisions of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable whatsoever.
9.11 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any rights or obligations of either party under this Agreement, shall be effective, except pursuant to a written instrument signed by the party or parties waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing.  The failure of either party to require the performance of any term of this Agreement or the waiver of either party of any breach under this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision hereof, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the other party hereto.

9.14 Equitable Relief.  The covenants of Licensee in Section 2 and Section 4 hereof are of a special and unique character, and Licensee acknowledges that money damages alone will not reasonably or adequately compensate RapidMiner for any breach of such covenants.  Therefore, RapidMiner and Licensee expressly agree that in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, in addition to other rights or remedies which RapidMiner may have, at law, in equity, or otherwise, RapidMiner shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief compelling specific performance of, and other compliance with, the terms of such Sections. 
9.15 Force Majeure.  RapidMiner shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance hereunder caused by reason of any occurrence or contingency beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, riot, civil disturbance, acts of any civil or military authority, judicial action, terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake, strike, delays in transportation, unavailability or shortages of labor, materials or equipment, failure or delays in delivery of vendors and suppliers, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, Internet disruptions, common carrier interruptions, breakdown in facilities, power failure or other accidents or unforeseen circumstances.  The obligations and rights so excused shall be extended on a day to day basis for the period of time equal to that of the underlying cause of the delay.
9.16 Remedies.  No remedy referred to in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to herein or otherwise available at law, in equity or otherwise.
9.17 Construction.  The section and paragraph headings used in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
