10.13 Equitable Relief.  The covenants of Licensee in Section 2 and Section 4 hereof are of a special and unique character, and Licensee acknowledges that money damages alone will not reasonably or adequately compensate RapidMiner for any breach of such covenants.

The obligations and rights so excused shall be extended on a day to day basis for the period of time equal to that of the underlying cause of the delay.
10.16 Remedies.  No remedy referred to in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to herein or otherwise available at law, in equity or otherwise.

Both parties acknowledge that they have been represented by counsel in the negotiation of this Agreement, and hereby waive any canon of construction that would require any portion of this Agreement to be construed against the drafter thereof.
