error.104.short = The ExampleSet contains non-numerical attribute ''{1}'' which is not allowed for {0}.
error.104.long  = Some learning schemes and algorithms can only handle numerical attributes. Consider using the 'Nominal to Numerical' or 'Parse Numbers' operators. 

error.105.name  = Missing label
error.105.short = Input ExampleSet does not have a label attribute.
error.105.long  = Many operators, in particular classifications and regressions, require a target attribute to be declared as label. To do so, you can use the 'Set Role' operator.
